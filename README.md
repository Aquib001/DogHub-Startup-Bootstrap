#Doghub Startup Website (Tinder Clone)

This is a brand new website that I have created from scratch using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4 under the guidance of the instructer Angela Bauer.
This was quite challenging to create as this is my first time using the Bootstrap Library. But this is a fun project and I am currently trying to finish and update the website as much as I can.
This website is hosted on netlify.
Update- This website is now completed with added functionalities to the buttons and the navbar items. It was wonderful journey and I enjoyed it. I will be moving forward to JS in depth from now on. Thank you.
